# 🗑️ Trash Review - Unused Files

This directory contains files that were identified as potentially unused and moved here for review.

## 📋 Contents

### Files moved based on analysis:
- **Junk files**: *.map, *.log, .DS_Store files
- **Unused images**: Images not referenced in source code
- **Build artifacts**: storybook-static, coverage, .nyc_output
- **Potentially unused TypeScript**: Files identified by ts-prune

## ⚠️ Review Process

**BEFORE PERMANENT DELETION:**
1. Run full test suite: `npm run test && npm run lint && npm run build`
2. Visual smoke test: Check Home, Dashboard, Quiz pages
3. Check if any files are needed for deployment or CI

**If tests pass and functionality is intact:**
- These files can be safely deleted
- Commit with message: "Clean: permanently remove unused files"

**If tests fail:**
- Move needed files back to original location
- Update this README with files that must be kept
