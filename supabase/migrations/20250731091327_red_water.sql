/*
  # Skip duplicate profiles insert policy

  1. Policy Management
    - Make profiles_insert_own policy creation idempotent
    - Prevent duplicate policy errors during migrations
    - Ensure single source of truth for policy definition

  2. Changes
    - Check if policy exists before creating
    - Skip creation if policy already exists
    - Log notice when skipping existing policy

  3. Notes
    - This migration should be run after removing duplicate policy creation from older migrations
    - Ensures clean migration runs without policy conflicts
